This is an upgraded version of repo surfer ---> Repo Surfer V2 
our main foucs of making this project is to help users in open source project exploration and contribution.

I divided the project making into many phases.
the phase0 includes desinging the pipline to fetch github repo , clone it ,get details related to its commit history, issues in the present repo using the git token.

with the phase0 i am onto the phase2 and am half way there , there are some issues realted to file path configurations which would be solved with the next commit so stay tuned.
